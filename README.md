# Civitas

This is an Android App designed to help individuals in a community to post/apply small household jobs. Say you have a Birthday Part coming up. 
You want to serve home cooked food for your guests. It is quite a challenge to prepare food for around 50 odd guests. So you decide to look for help from
members of your community. You can post job in Civitas and anyone from your locality can view the job that was posted by you. The vision of this app is to help localites 
make that extra income.
